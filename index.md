## Justin Purcell

I am currently a software engineer at IBM. I use Javascript and various contemporary libraries (`React`, `Redux`) to create elegant web solutions for users.

My primary focus during my undergraduate and graduate careers was `Computational Linguistics`. I also thoroughly enjoyed courses on `Blockchain` and `Japanese Linguistics`.
